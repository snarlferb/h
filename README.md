# hidden/temporary for blush (blue shell)

- Note, that this is a simplified summary/explanation of the features and changes that are to come with it...

## What we'll mean by the term 'buffer'?
- [ ] In order to describe some changes appropriately, i have to discuss this term *buffer*, as its very much integral to the way the shell manages characters and commands; A buffer (specifically an input buffer) acts as a temporary storage area used to manage and manipulate characters and strings as they are inputted by the user, and eventually, processed as commands. The command history buffer stores previously entered commands and allows you to recall and reuse them. And the display buffer holds the current state of the command line as it appears on the screen.
- [ ] Buffering then refers to how the shell handles the input before it's executed. Typically, when you paste multiple lines of code or commands into a shell with buffering enabled, it retains those lines in an input buffer, allowing you to edit or review them before submitting them for execution, and thats one such thing we plan to reshape...
## Reshaping the Plains of Convention
- [ ] Implement the histsearch (otherwise known as "Reverse-i-search") for processing on the same line; and that way it doesnt submit lines for each character on the search buffer, or submitting any input pasted in from the data buffer (clipboard). This is called "non-incremental search" (nsearch) which refers to a search operation where the query is built up entirely in the buffer before any action is taken based on it. This means that characters are typed into the search field (line buffer), but they aren’t processed or submitted until the full search string is complete. If you have a minimal shell that uses "incremental search", results are updated immediately after each keypress, and as such, it doesnt allow you to enter the entire string of characters as a compound search query.
- [ ] Automatic line editing and buffering, with the ability to recall previous commands from history, edit them before execution, and search through command history, etc, as stated.
- [ ] Commands and other such kinds of ideas: complit (a more organized compgen), readarray (myarray=()...etc), logout (more specific exit) and we will think of necessary commands as we go.
## Normal Mode in xterm
- [ ] "Normal mode" in xterm refers to a default state in which the terminal is awaiting input or is in an idle state, responding to mouse and keyboard events (such as clicks or key presses). It's not tied to any specific concept like Vim’s normal mode, where it's specifically about command vs. insert modes. Instead, xterm's "normal mode" is just a generic mode for interaction where events are tracked—like mouse movements or button clicks—but not in a specific "command" or "edit" context. I want to highlight this just in case we begin to use this term to describe some default state of the shell.
## Introduction to Panels (aka Presets)
- [ ] I think of Panels, in the same way that i imagine the X/O Panels being activated or flipped (if you never had those at your local playground, then you have no idea what im talking about)
- [ ] Normal mode should be a simplification upon commands—that is, a constant layer that you have the option of customizing yourself. My original idea (which was overly complex and relied too much on preserving standards and common conventions) had something to do with resetting the binding target sequence (e.g., `"\C-d"`), setting each simplification to the binding action (e.g., `_B_` or whatever) which would presumably be found in `~/.panelrc`. Each of those Panels were: "n-", "ins-", "mi-" and "ur-" panel, and could be activated upon pressing Mod+Key or F8, F9, F0, F1, etc (`bindkey "\033OP" custom-function`)

- [ ] That idea is still very much apart of what im thinking, however, Vi mode would not exist at all, and Emacs would be very different behind the scenes. Instead, now it would be considered a wholly separate system. I figured, it simplifies things greatly to just have one holistic idea, replacing "Emacs vs Vi" paradigm... Now its just a Custom Preset (Panels) which gives you the ability to change a preset of keybindings—that is, itself, bound to a key initially (to one you so desire). It should be noted, that the default-preset would NOT resemble Vi (or Emacs) but rather a fusion of Vi+Emacs (this is just my personal preference in a shell environment) however you would ostensibly have the ability to mimick Vi and Emacs modes in the end (im just speculating on what i think could be the case, but im certain i can add enough functionality so that one can try to make it behave in a "Vi-like" way again) *P.s. you would still use `set -o` to see all active/available modes*, but "vi" would no longer exist on that list, and would be replaced with the term "custom-preset". Note: If you want to have a preset selected without it being swappable, that should be easy for us to make, programmatically speaking.
